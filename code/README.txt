The exact attributions for the toy examples are run in the "hiring_a_mover_example.ipynb" notebook.
For more information on the MultivariateBernoulli object used to run these toy model examples, look at "multivariate_bernoulli_example.ipynb"

The case-studies are in the "*_case_study.ipynb" notebooks.

Lastly, the "comparing_with_shap.ipynb" gives an example of Lemma 1 and demonstrates the value of confidence intervals.
